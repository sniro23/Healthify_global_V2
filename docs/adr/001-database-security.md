# ADR 001: Database Security with Supabase Row Level Security

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As a healthcare application, Healthify Digital Hub deals with sensitive patient data that must be protected according to healthcare regulations and best practices. We need to ensure that users only have access to data they're authorized to see, while maintaining performance and developer experience.

## Decision

We will use Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) as the primary mechanism for enforcing data access controls at the database level. This approach ensures security rules are enforced consistently regardless of access path.

Key decisions:

1. **Use RLS for All Tables**: Every table containing sensitive information will have RLS enabled.

2. **Role-Based Security Model**: Access will be based on user roles (patient, doctor, admin) and relationships between entities.

3. **Helper Functions**: We'll create reusable SQL functions to encapsulate common security checks.

4. **Explicit Policies**: Each operation type (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) will have its own policy with explicit conditions.

5. **Security Testing**: RLS policies will be tested as part of our CI/CD pipeline.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Defense in Depth**: Security is enforced at the database level, not just in application code.
- **Consistent Security**: Rules are applied consistently across all access paths.
- **Reduced Developer Error**: Developers can't accidentally bypass security by forgetting to add checks in application code.
- **Performance**: RLS policies can leverage database indexes for efficient checking.
- **Declarative Approach**: Security rules are defined in a declarative, centralized way.

### Negative

- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand RLS concepts and PostgreSQL-specific syntax.
- **Complexity**: Complex access patterns may require sophisticated policies.
- **Debugging Challenges**: It may be harder to debug access issues since restrictions happen at the database level.
- **Testing Overhead**: Need comprehensive testing of security rules across different scenarios.
- **Performance Considerations**: Poorly written policies could impact query performance.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Application-Level Security Only**: Enforce access controls only in the application code.
   - Rejected due to risk of developer oversight and inconsistent enforcement.

2. **Middleware Layer**: Create a middleware layer that enforces security before database access.
   - Rejected due to added complexity and potential inconsistencies.

3. **Views and Functions Only**: Use database views and functions with embedded security logic.
   - Partially adopted, but RLS provides a more comprehensive solution.

## Implementation Approach

1. Create helper functions for common security checks.
2. Define RLS policies for each table focusing on the most restricted operations first.
3. Implement testing infrastructure for RLS policies.
4. Create documentation and developer guides for working with RLS.

## Related Decisions

- Selection of Supabase as our database platform
- Authentication and identity management approach

## Notes

RLS policies should be regularly reviewed as the application evolves to ensure they continue to meet security requirements. Performance implications of complex policies should be monitored.
