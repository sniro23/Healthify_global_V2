# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Healthify Digital Hub project.

## Overview

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They serve as a historical record of the project's evolution and help new team members understand why certain choices were made.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a standard format:

1. **Title**: A descriptive title prefixed with a sequential number
2. **Status**: Current status (proposed, accepted, superseded, etc.)
3. **Context**: The setting in which the decision was made
4. **Decision**: The decision that was made
5. **Consequences**: What happens after the decision is applied
6. **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were considered
7. **Implementation Approach**: How the decision will be implemented
8. **Related Decisions**: Links to related ADRs or decisions
9. **Notes**: Additional information or references
