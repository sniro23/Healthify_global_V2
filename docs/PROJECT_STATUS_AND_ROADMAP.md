## Implementation Details

### Component Architecture

The UI component architecture follows a hierarchical structure:

1. **Base UI Components** (`packages/ui-kit/src/components/ui`)
   - Button, Input, Card, etc.
   - Foundational elements used across the application

2. **Domain-Specific Components**
   - **Auth Components** (`packages/ui-kit/src/components/auth`)
     - LoginForm, RegisterForm, etc.
   - **EHR Components** (`packages/ui-kit/src/components/ehr`)
     - PatientSummary, MedicationList, etc.
   - **Navigation Components** (`packages/ui-kit/src/components/navigation`)
     - BottomNav, SideNav, etc.

3. **Layout Components** (app-specific)
   - PatientPortalLayout
   - DoctorPortalLayout

   - MedicationList - List of patient medications
   - ObservationList - List of patient observations
   - ConditionList - List of patient conditions

2. **Health Metrics Visualization**
   - Timeline views (planned)
   - Trending charts (planned)
   - Comparative analysis (planned)

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14.2
- **UI Library**: React 18.3
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Package Management**: pnpm with workspaces
